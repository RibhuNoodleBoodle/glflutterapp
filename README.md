# An openGL test app

An early attempt to create a hardware accelerated openGL application.

## Getting Started

It doesn't work (yet). So, unless you know what you're doing (which is more than me lol), there's nothing in this app that would work. The issue is that there is a consistent lack of quality packages for openGL. I've already imported like six packages and none of them work the way it should. It also doesn't help the fact that (at the time of this writing) my experience on writing dart packages is... somewhat... limited. So, unless you know what you're doing feel free to contribute; I'll appreciate it.
